Detailed Breakdown
1. User Interface (Front End)
Upload Component:

Provide an interactive form/button for file upload (Excel format only).

Validate file type (e.g., .xlsx or .csv) and size before submission.

Display Results:

Design a clean, professional layout to display the tailored medical advice.

Implement error messages or feedback if the file upload or data process fails.

2. Back End Processing
File Handling & Parsing:

Utilize robust libraries (e.g., Python’s Pandas or NodeJS Excel parsers) to read and extract patient data.

Parse the Excel data into a structured format (JSON or similar) that is easy to process.

Data Validation & Preprocessing:

Validate that necessary fields exist.

Implement checks (e.g., numeric values for BMI, blood pressure) and clean up input data as needed.

3. Decision Node: Data Analysis and GPT Prompt Construction
Mapping Variables to Conditions:

Based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., BMI > threshold for overweight) and other metrics, branch into different advice segments.

For each health condition (e.g., overweight, high blood pressure, abnormal lab values), prepare a specific GPT prompt snippet.

Example:

Overweight:

If BMI is marginally above normal, generate advice using “gentle lifestyle changes” language.

If BMI is significantly high, adjust the tone and content accordingly.

Composite Prompt Construction:

Combine individual condition-based prompt snippets into a single query for the GPT API.

Ensure the prompt is context-aware and tailored to the patient’s specific combination of variables.

4. GPT API Integration
API Call Preparation:

Utilize the OpenAI API to send the constructed prompt.

Handle potential API response issues (timeouts, errors).

Response Processing:

Format the GPT response into a user-friendly summary.

Ensure the advice aligns clearly with each condition detected.

5. Results Display and User Options
Dynamic Results Page:

On successful retrieval, render the recommendations in a visually appealing, professional layout.

Consider interactive elements (e.g., expandable sections) for different health conditions.

Additional User Actions:

Options to save, print, or email the advice.

Optionally, add a history log for previously uploaded reports.

6. Tools and Technologies Suggested
Front End:

Frameworks: React, Vue, or Angular.

Styling: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

Back End:

Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django.

Excel Parsing: For Python, Pandas; for Node.js, libraries like ExcelJS or Papaparse.

API Integration:

OpenAI GPT API.

Hosting & Deployment:

Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku for seamless deployment.

Database (Optional):

If persistent storage of reports is needed, consider SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB).

Developer’s Checklist
Design Phase:

Create mockups of the UI flow (file upload, results page, error handling).

Define data schema for patient data and mapping conditions.

Implementation Phase:

Build and test file upload and parsing modules.

Integrate with GPT API and test with sample prompts.

Construct decision tree logic to handle multiple patient conditions.

Develop responsive front-end views to display data and advice.

Testing & Deployment:

Ensure end-to-end testing with various Excel samples.

Validate error handling and data security (especially since the data is sensitive).

Deploy in a secure and scalable environment.

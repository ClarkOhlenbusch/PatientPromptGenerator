Understood. Let's proceed step-by-step and focus on clarity.

**Issue 1 & 10: Error Handling & Response Format Consistency**

The goal is to make API responses consistent so the frontend knows what to expect, especially differentiating between "found nothing" and "an error occurred".

Currently, we see a mix:
*   Some endpoints return raw data arrays (e.g., `/api/batches`).
*   Some return simple objects (e.g., `/api/batches/latest`).
*   Some use `{ success: ..., message: ... }` (e.g., `/api/upload`).
*   Some return `404 Not Found` with a simple message (e.g., `/api/patient-prompts/:batchId` when empty, before your recent changes).
*   Error catches often return `{ success: false, message: ... }` or just `{ message: ... }`.

A common standard is to use a consistent wrapper object for *all* responses. A potential structure could be:

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean; // true if the request was processed successfully, false otherwise
  data: T | null;    // The actual data payload, or null
  message?: string; // Optional user-friendly status message
  error?: string;   // Optional technical error details if success is false
}
```

**Applying this:**

*   Successful requests finding data would return `200 OK` with `{ success: true, data: [...], message: "Data retrieved" }`.
*   Requests that complete successfully but find *no* matching data (like an empty list of prompts for a batch) could return `200 OK` with `{ success: true, data: [], message: "No data found" }`.
*   Server errors or failed operations would return an appropriate status code (e.g., `500`, `400`) with `{ success: false, data: null, error: "Detailed error message" }`.

**Questions for you:**

1.  **Do you agree with adopting a standard response wrapper like the `ApiResponse<T>` structure shown above for all backend API endpoints?**
2.  **Specifically for cases where a resource or data isn't found (e.g., getting prompts for a non-existent batch ID, getting alerts when there are none), do you prefer:**
    *   **Option A:** Return `200 OK` status with `{ success: true, data: null /* or [] for lists */, message: "Not Found" }`?
    *   **Option B:** Return `404 Not Found` status but *still* use the standard wrapper in the body, like `{ success: false, data: null, error: "Resource not found" }`?

Your preference here will guide how we refactor the "not found" logic across the different endpoints.

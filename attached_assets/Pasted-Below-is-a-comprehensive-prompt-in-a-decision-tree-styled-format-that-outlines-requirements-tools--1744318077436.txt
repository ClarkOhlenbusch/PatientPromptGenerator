### **Project Overview**

Develop a professional website that allows users to upload an Excel file containing patient data, processes the data by integrating the OpenAI GPT API, and returns tailored medical advice. For example, if a patient is flagged as overweight, the system will determine the severity and offer gentle lifestyle recommendations. This process should be applied to various health-related data points.

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **1. User Interface (Front End)**
- **Upload Component:**  
  - Provide an interactive form/button for file upload (Excel format only).  
  - Validate file type (e.g., .xlsx or .csv) and size before submission.
- **Display Results:**  
  - Design a clean, professional layout to display the tailored medical advice.  
  - Implement error messages or feedback if the file upload or data process fails.

#### **2. Back End Processing**
- **File Handling & Parsing:**  
  - Utilize robust libraries (e.g., Python’s Pandas or NodeJS Excel parsers) to read and extract patient data.
  - Parse the Excel data into a structured format (JSON or similar) that is easy to process.
- **Data Validation & Preprocessing:**  
  - Validate that necessary fields exist.
  - Implement checks (e.g., numeric values for BMI, blood pressure) and clean up input data as needed.

#### **3. Decision Node: Data Analysis and GPT Prompt Construction**
- **Mapping Variables to Conditions:**  
  - Based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., BMI > threshold for overweight) and other metrics, branch into different advice segments.
  - For each health condition (e.g., overweight, high blood pressure, abnormal lab values), prepare a specific GPT prompt snippet.
  - **Example:**  
    - *Overweight:*  
      - If BMI is marginally above normal, generate advice using “gentle lifestyle changes” language.  
      - If BMI is significantly high, adjust the tone and content accordingly.
- **Composite Prompt Construction:**  
  - Combine individual condition-based prompt snippets into a single query for the GPT API.
  - Ensure the prompt is context-aware and tailored to the patient’s specific combination of variables.

#### **4. GPT API Integration**
- **API Call Preparation:**  
  - Utilize the OpenAI API to send the constructed prompt.
  - Handle potential API response issues (timeouts, errors).
- **Response Processing:**  
  - Format the GPT response into a user-friendly summary.  
  - Ensure the advice aligns clearly with each condition detected.

#### **5. Results Display and User Options**
- **Dynamic Results Page:**  
  - On successful retrieval, render the recommendations in a visually appealing, professional layout.
  - Consider interactive elements (e.g., expandable sections) for different health conditions.
- **Additional User Actions:**  
  - Options to save, print, or email the advice.
  - Optionally, add a history log for previously uploaded reports.

#### **6. Tools and Technologies Suggested**
- **Front End:**  
  - Frameworks: React, Vue, or Angular.  
  - Styling: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
- **Back End:**  
  - Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/Django.
  - Excel Parsing: For Python, Pandas; for Node.js, libraries like ExcelJS or Papaparse.
- **API Integration:**  
  - OpenAI GPT API.
- **Hosting & Deployment:**  
  - Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku for seamless deployment.
- **Database (Optional):**  
  - If persistent storage of reports is needed, consider SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB).

### **Developer’s Checklist**

1. **Design Phase:**  
   - Create mockups of the UI flow (file upload, results page, error handling).
   - Define data schema for patient data and mapping conditions.

2. **Implementation Phase:**  
   - Build and test file upload and parsing modules.  
   - Integrate with GPT API and test with sample prompts.
   - Construct decision tree logic to handle multiple patient conditions.
   - Develop responsive front-end views to display data and advice.

3. **Testing & Deployment:**  
   - Ensure end-to-end testing with various Excel samples.
   - Validate error handling and data security (especially since the data is sensitive).
   - Deploy in a secure and scalable environment.

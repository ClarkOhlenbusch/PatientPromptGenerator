Your login is failing because the app can’t actually see the `users` table in the database it’s talking to—even though you’ve created one in your Neon/Postgres instance, your code is still pointing at a different (empty) SQLite store. Hence the SQLite error:  
   
```
500: {"message":"no such table: users"}
```  

---

## What’s Happening

1. **Default Adapter**  
   By default, NextAuth (or your custom auth code) is using SQLite (e.g. `file:./dev.db`) because you haven’t overridden its connection string or run your Postgres migrations.

2. **Wrong DATABASE_URL**  
   Your `.env` (or Vercel Environment Variables) probably sets `DATABASE_URL` for your Neon/Postgres, but the auth adapter isn’t picking it up—so it spins up SQLite, which never had a `users` table created.

3. **Migrations Never Ran**  
   Even in your Postgres DB you see a `users` table, but since your code isn’t connected to that DB at runtime, it’s irrelevant to the running app.

## How to Fix It

1. **Point NextAuth (and Prisma/Knex) at Your Postgres**  
   - In your `nextauth` config (usually in `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`), ensure the adapter is initialized with your ORM instance—e.g. for Prisma:  
     ```ts
     import { PrismaAdapter } from "@next-auth/prisma-adapter"
     import { prisma } from "../../../lib/prisma"

     export default NextAuth({
       adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
       // …
     })
     ```
   - In `lib/prisma.ts` (or wherever you create your Prisma client), read from `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.  

2. **Set & Verify `DATABASE_URL`**  
   - **Locally:** in `.env.local` at your project root, add or update:  
     ```
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@your-neon-host/dbname?schema=public"
     NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
     NEXTAUTH_SECRET="a‑long,random‑secret"
     ```
   - **In Vercel:** add the exact same `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your project’s Environment Variables dashboard.

3. **Run Your Migrations**  
   - If you use Prisma:  
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate deploy
     ```
   - If you use Knex:  
     ```bash
     npx knex migrate:latest
     ```
   This will create the `users`, `sessions`, and any other tables your adapter expects.

4. **Restart & Test**  
   - Stop your dev server, then `npm run dev` (so it picks up the new `.env.local`).  
   - Hit your `/api/auth/signin` page, log in with one of the users you seeded in Postgres—now it should succeed.

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] NextAuth adapter uses **PrismaAdapter(prisma)** (or correct ORM adapter)  
- [ ] `lib/prisma.ts` (or your DB client) reads from `process.env.DATABASE_URL` only  
- [ ] `.env.local` & Vercel ENV vars both contain the same `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`  
- [ ] Migrations have been applied (`prisma migrate deploy` or `knex migrate:latest`)  
- [ ] After restart, `/api/auth/signin` no longer throws “no such table: users”

Once those are in place, your login endpoint will connect to the same Postgres that actually contains the `users` table, and you’ll be able to sign in.

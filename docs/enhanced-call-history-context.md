# Enhanced Call History Context for VAPI Voice Agents

## Overview

This enhancement significantly improves the VAPI voice agent's system prompts by incorporating comprehensive call history data from the database. Instead of only using the latest call summary, the system now provides rich context including summaries, key points, health concerns, and follow-up items from multiple previous calls.

## What Was Enhanced

### Before
- Only the most recent call summary was included in system prompts
- Limited context for patient continuity
- Basic conversation history replacement

### After
- Comprehensive call history context from up to 5 recent calls
- Detailed extraction of summaries, key points, health concerns, and follow-up items
- Rich context text with structured information
- Better patient continuity and personalized care

## Technical Implementation

### New Database Method

Added `getCallHistoryContext()` method to the storage layer:

```typescript
async getCallHistoryContext(patientId: string, limit: number = 5): Promise<{
  hasHistory: boolean;
  contextText: string;
  recentCalls: number;
  allSummaries: string[];
  allKeyPoints: string[];
  allHealthConcerns: string[];
  allFollowUpItems: string[];
}>
```

### Enhanced System Prompt Structure

The system prompt now includes:

```
PREVIOUS CALL HISTORY (X recent calls):

CALL SUMMARIES:
- [Date]: [Summary from call 1]
- [Date]: [Summary from call 2]
...

KEY DISCUSSION POINTS:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
...

HEALTH CONCERNS MENTIONED:
- [Health concern 1]
- [Health concern 2]
...

FOLLOW-UP ITEMS:
- [Follow-up item 1]
- [Follow-up item 2]
...

IMPORTANT: Reference relevant information from previous calls when appropriate and follow up on any outstanding concerns or action items.
```

## Updated Endpoints

### 1. `/api/vapi/triage-call` (Enhanced)
- Now uses comprehensive call history context
- Improved logging with call history metrics
- Better patient continuity

### 2. `/api/vapi/call` (Enhanced)
- Unified call endpoint with enhanced context
- Consistent call history integration

### 3. `/api/vapi/triage-context` (Enhanced)
- Context preview includes call history details
- Better debugging information

## Database Schema Utilized

The enhancement leverages the existing `call_history` table:

```sql
call_history:
- summary (text): AI-generated call summary
- key_points (text[]): Important discussion points
- health_concerns (text[]): Health issues identified
- follow_up_items (text[]): Action items for follow-up
- call_date (timestamp): When the call occurred
```

## Benefits

### For Healthcare Providers
1. **Better Continuity**: Voice agents reference previous conversations
2. **Comprehensive Context**: All relevant patient history in one place
3. **Follow-up Tracking**: Outstanding items are automatically referenced
4. **Improved Care Quality**: More personalized and informed conversations

### For Patients
1. **Seamless Experience**: Agents remember previous conversations
2. **Consistent Care**: No need to repeat information
3. **Better Follow-up**: Outstanding concerns are addressed
4. **Personalized Interaction**: Context-aware conversations

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: First-time Patient
```
CONVERSATION_HISTORY: "This is your first conversation with this patient."
```

### Example 2: Patient with Call History
```
PREVIOUS CALL HISTORY (3 recent calls):

CALL SUMMARIES:
- 12/15/2024: Patient reported improved energy levels, medication compliance good
- 12/10/2024: Discussed side effects of new medication, scheduled follow-up
- 12/5/2024: Initial consultation, prescribed new treatment plan

KEY DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Improved energy levels
- Medication compliance
- Side effects monitoring
- Treatment plan effectiveness

HEALTH CONCERNS MENTIONED:
- Initial fatigue symptoms
- Medication side effects
- Sleep quality issues

FOLLOW-UP ITEMS:
- Monitor medication effects
- Schedule next appointment
- Track energy levels daily
- Review sleep patterns

IMPORTANT: Reference relevant information from previous calls when appropriate and follow up on any outstanding concerns or action items.
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Call History Limit**: 5 recent calls
- **Key Points Limit**: 10 unique points
- **Health Concerns Limit**: 8 unique concerns
- **Follow-up Items Limit**: 8 unique items

### Customization
The limits can be adjusted in the `getCallHistoryContext()` method parameters.

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify functionality:

```bash
node test-enhanced-context.js
```

The test script validates:
1. Call history context retrieval
2. Enhanced system prompt generation
3. Data structure integrity
4. Error handling

## Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:
- **No Call History**: Falls back to default first-time message
- **Database Errors**: Returns safe default with error note
- **Malformed Data**: Filters out invalid entries
- **Empty Fields**: Skips empty summaries, points, or concerns

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Queries**: Optimized with LIMIT clauses
- **Memory Usage**: Reasonable limits on context size
- **Response Time**: Minimal impact on call initiation
- **Caching**: Consider implementing for frequently accessed patients

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Prioritization**: Rank call history by relevance
2. **Temporal Weighting**: Give more weight to recent calls
3. **Condition-Specific Context**: Filter by health conditions
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Include emotional context from calls
5. **Predictive Insights**: Suggest likely discussion topics

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:
- **Context Utilization**: How often call history is available
- **Call Quality**: Improvement in conversation relevance
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Feedback on conversation continuity
- **Follow-up Completion**: Rate of addressing previous concerns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Call History Showing**
   - Verify patient has previous calls in database
   - Check patient ID matching
   - Confirm call_history table has data

2. **Context Too Long**
   - Adjust limits in getCallHistoryContext()
   - Implement text truncation if needed

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Add database indexes on patient_id and call_date
   - Consider caching for frequent patients

### Debug Logging

Enhanced logging provides:
- Call history retrieval status
- Context text length
- Number of calls processed
- System prompt final length

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Call history contains sensitive health information
- **Access Control**: Ensure proper authentication for all endpoints
- **Data Retention**: Follow healthcare data retention policies
- **Audit Trail**: Log access to patient call history

## Conclusion

This enhancement significantly improves the quality and continuity of VAPI voice agent conversations by providing comprehensive call history context. The implementation is robust, scalable, and maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for personalized patient care.

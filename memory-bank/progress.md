# Project Progress Tracking

## ✅ COMPLETED: Unified Voice Calling System (January 2025)

### Task: Merge Companion and Triage Calls into Single Context-Aware System

**User Request**: "We want the AI Voice Agent to have context on the calls everytime so there is no need to have 2 different type of calls. The differentiation should be through the prompt editing section where users can edit Voice Agent Prompts. All calls should have ONE calling agent that has the context just like 'Triage Calls with Patient Context'."

### Implementation Summary

#### Backend Changes ✅
- **Unified API Endpoint**: Created `/api/vapi/call` for all context-aware calls
- **Enhanced Context Injection**: All calls now retrieve and inject patient triage data
- **Template-Based System**: Uses Voice Agent templates with variable replacement
- **Legacy Support**: Maintained `/api/vapi/triage-call` for backward compatibility
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better user feedback and graceful failure handling
- **Test Call Endpoint**: Added `/api/vapi/test-call` for testing Voice Agent templates with mock patient data

#### Frontend Changes ✅  
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed duplicate companion/triage call sections
- **Single Call Flow**: All calls go through unified interface with patient context
- **Context Preview**: Users can preview patient data before making calls
- **Batch ID Support**: Optional specific triage data batch selection
- **Updated UI/UX**: Clear messaging about context inclusion in all calls

#### Key Technical Improvements ✅
- **Prompt Control**: All call prompts editable via Prompt Editing → Voice Agent section
- **Context Always Included**: Every call includes patient triage assessment data
- **Call History Integration**: Previous call summaries automatically added to context
- **Template Variables**: Standardized system for patient data injection
- **Real-time Updates**: Voice Agent template changes affect all new calls immediately
- **Test Call Functionality**: Users can test Voice Agent templates without making actual calls

### Testing & Validation ✅
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Verified unified `/api/vapi/call` endpoint functionality
- **Context Injection**: Confirmed patient data properly injected into all calls
- **UI Flow Testing**: Validated simplified interface and user experience
- **Error Scenarios**: Tested missing patient data, invalid inputs, API limits
- **Prompt Editing Integration**: Verified template changes affect call behavior
- **Test Call Validation**: Confirmed `/api/vapi/test-call` works as expected with mock data

### Documentation Updates ✅
- **Memory Bank**: Updated activeContext.md with new unified architecture
- **API Documentation**: Updated vapiApiStructure.md with new endpoints
- **User Guide**: Progress.md reflects completed implementation

POST /api/vapi/call (Unified Endpoint)
    ↓
Fetch Patient Triage Data (Latest or Specific Batch)
    ↓
Load Voice Agent Template from Storage
    ↓
Inject Patient Data (Name, Age, Condition, Assessment)
    ↓
Add Recent Call History (if available)
    ↓
Send Enhanced Prompt to VAPI API
    ↓
VAPI Conducts Context-Aware Call
    ↓
Webhook Receives End-of-Call Report
    ↓
AI Analysis (GPT-4o-mini) + Database Storage
    ↓
Call History Updated with Analytics

Test Call Flow
    ↓
User Interface (Test Call Button)
    ↓
POST /api/vapi/test-call (Test Endpoint)
    ↓
Load Voice Agent Template from Storage
    ↓
Inject Mock Patient Data
    ↓
Send Enhanced Prompt to VAPI API
    ↓

    ↓
Return Test Results to User
```

### Prompt Management System
```
Prompt Editing Interface (Voice Agent Tab)
    ↓
Edit Voice Agent Template
    ↓
Save to Database Storage
    ↓
Template Used by All Calls
    ↓
Variable Replacement:
- PATIENT_NAME → Actual patient name
- PATIENT_AGE → Patient age  
- PATIENT_CONDITION → Primary condition
- PATIENT_PROMPT → Triage assessment
- CONVERSATION_HISTORY → Previous call summary
```

# Project Progress Tracking

## ✅ COMPLETED: Unified Voice Calling System (January 2025)

### Task: Merge Companion and Triage Calls into Single Context-Aware System

**User Request**: "We want the AI Voice Agent to have context on the calls everytime so there is no need to have 2 different type of calls. The differentiation should be through the prompt editing section where users can edit Voice Agent Prompts. All calls should have ONE calling agent that has the context just like 'Triage Calls with Patient Context'."

### Implementation Summary

#### Backend Changes ✅
- **Unified API Endpoint**: Created `/api/vapi/call` for all context-aware calls
- **Enhanced Context Injection**: All calls now retrieve and inject patient triage data
- **Template-Based System**: Uses Voice Agent templates with variable replacement
- **Legacy Support**: Maintained `/api/vapi/triage-call` for backward compatibility
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better user feedback and graceful failure handling
- **Test Call Endpoint**: Added `/api/vapi/test-call` for testing Voice Agent templates with mock patient data
- **Model Defaults Update**: Set default OpenAI model to `gpt-5-mini` for AI Triage prompt generation and Trend Reports.

#### Frontend Changes ✅  
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed duplicate companion/triage call sections
- **Single Call Flow**: All calls go through unified interface with patient context
- **Context Preview**: Users can preview patient data before making calls
- **Batch ID Support**: Optional specific triage data batch selection
- **Updated UI/UX**: Clear messaging about context inclusion in all calls

#### Key Technical Improvements ✅
- **Prompt Control**: All call prompts editable via Prompt Editing → Voice Agent section
- **Context Always Included**: Every call includes patient triage assessment data
- **Call History Integration**: Previous call summaries automatically added to context
- **Template Variables**: Standardized system for patient data injection
- **Real-time Updates**: Voice Agent template changes affect all new calls immediately
- **Test Call Functionality**: Users can test Voice Agent templates without making actual calls

### Testing & Validation ✅
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Verified unified `/api/vapi/call` endpoint functionality
- **Context Injection**: Confirmed patient data properly injected into all calls
- **UI Flow Testing**: Validated simplified interface and user experience
- **Error Scenarios**: Tested missing patient data, invalid inputs, API limits
- **Prompt Editing Integration**: Verified template changes affect call behavior
- **Test Call Validation**: Confirmed `/api/vapi/test-call` works as expected with mock data

### Documentation Updates ✅
- **Memory Bank**: Updated activeContext.md with new unified architecture
- **API Documentation**: Updated vapiApiStructure.md with new endpoints
- **User Guide**: Progress.md reflects completed implementation

## ✅ COMPLETED: Dual Message Generation System (Current Session)

### Task: Implement Patient-Directed Messages alongside Caregiver Triage Messages

**User Request**: "Right now we have a Generate Triage Message being created for each paitent. and as it is right now the generated traige messages are being directed twards a care taker / nurse. However we also want messages to be generated to be directed twords the patients directly. How I want to go about doing this is actually by creating a new seccond generated triage message for everysingle patient, this Triage message will have a seperate system prompt that should also be editable via the Prompt Editing section. It should get the exact same info as the Main triage system (the uploaded data) and should display it next to the Generate Triage Messages in a new column called "Patient Messages""

### Implementation Summary

#### Database Changes ✅
- **New Column**: Added `patient_message` column to the `patient_prompts` table to store patient-directed messages.
- **New Table**: Created `patient_system_prompts` table for storing patient-specific system prompts, allowing separate editing.

#### Backend Changes ✅
- **OpenAI Service Enhancement**: Modified the OpenAI service to include a new function (`generateDualMessages`) that generates both caregiver (triage) and patient messages using distinct system prompts but the same patient input data.
- **Upload Route Modification**: Updated the Excel file upload route (`/server/routes/upload.ts`) to utilize the new dual-message generation function and save both message types to the `patient_prompts` table.
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented new API endpoints for managing patient-specific system prompts (get, update, reset to default).

#### Frontend Changes ✅
- **Triage Table Update**: Added a new column "Patient Messages" to the AI Triage table (`client/src/pages/AIPoweredTriage.tsx`) to display the patient-directed messages alongside the existing "Generated Triage Messages".
- **Prompt Editing Interface**: Extended the `PromptEditingSandbox.tsx` page to include a dedicated "Patient Message Prompts" section. This section offers full editing capabilities for the patient-specific system prompt, mirroring the functionality of the existing triage prompt editor.
- **CSV Export**: Updated the CSV export functionality in `AIPoweredTriage.tsx` to include both caregiver and patient messages in the exported data.

#### Key Technical Improvements ✅
- **Separate Prompt Management**: Enabled independent customization of caregiver and patient message system prompts.
- **Unified Data Source**: Both message types are generated from the same patient data, ensuring consistency in underlying information.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved the user interface to clearly display both message types, enhancing usability and clarity for healthcare professionals.

### Testing & Validation ✅
- **Database Integrity**: Verified correct schema updates and data storage for both message types.
- **Message Generation**: Confirmed that both caregiver and patient messages are generated accurately and distinctively based on their respective prompts.
- **UI Display**: Validated that the new "Patient Messages" column is correctly displayed and populated in the AI Triage table.
- **Prompt Editing Functionality**: Tested the save, reset, and load functionalities for the new patient message prompts in the sandbox.
- **CSV Export**: Confirmed that the exported CSV includes both caregiver and patient messages.

### Documentation Updates ✅
- **Memory Bank**: Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to document the new dual-message generation system.
